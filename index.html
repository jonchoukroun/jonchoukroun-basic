                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <article>
                            <p>I've been a software engineer with Apple for 4 years, working mostly on the iCloud Mail web client. Before that, I worked for a stock photography startup called Twenty20. Unfortunately, that company was acquired and later shuttered.</p>
                            <p>Much earlier, I worked in the music industry as a sound engineer. I recorded and mixed artists across genres, and did some composing/scoring for commercials (and one <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2814153/" target="_blank">film</a>).</p>
                            <p>EventuallyI went back to college, studying International Relations at the University of Southern California, and International Economic Policy from George Washington University. These subjects aren't related to what I do now, but I still consider them a valuable education and experience.</p>
                            <p>After a short time working in managment consulting (which I strongly discourage), I taught myself to code. Starting with basic web development, I learned quickly and accumulated quite a few knowledge gaps. But my priority was getting just competent enough to land a job, regardless of how much learning debt I accrued. It paid off, as Twenty20 hired me after roughly 6 months. The engineering manager took a chance on easily the greenest developer, which let me grow and learn from skilled and experienced engineers.</p>
                            <p>I've always been a passionate learner, if not a great student. The projects detailed on this site illustrate some of the interests I've pursued.</p>

                <p>A small selection of projects I've completed.</p>
                <p>These are highlighted because they reflect an interest I chose to purse: a specific type of programming, a tech stack/language, or just something cool I wanted to explore.</p>
