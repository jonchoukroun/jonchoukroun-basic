        <h2 class="container-title">About Me</h2>
        <article class="text-content">
            <p>I was born in the land of sunshine and surf, Orange County, California. Started my career as a sound engineer, a composer, an arranger in the mad world of music production and television advertising. But I became bored with the same old beat and sought a new challenge.</p>
            <p>Traded in the mixing board and earned a bachelor's degree in International Relations from the University of California, then a master's in International Economic Policy from George Washington University. This led to a gig in management consulting at CEB, for the financial services industry.</p>
            <p>But it was programming that really got me excited. I taught myself to code, starting with Ruby and Javascript. Self-taught skills landed me a software engineer gig at Twenty20, a startup platform for stock photography. I kept learning - at work and on side projects - adding Elixir, Typescript, C and C++ to my repertoire.</p>
            <p>These days, I'm putting my skills to use on Apple's iCloud Mail team, making sure folks' emails are safe and sound. You see, I've always had a nose for cybersecurity and user privacy, and I believe in using technology to protect folks from the bad guys. I may not be a private eye, but I know how to dig deep and solve a problem.</p>
            <p>When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me spending time with my wife and daughter, playing a game of chess, watching baseball, or reading a novel.</p>

            <small>The above bio was generated by ChatGPT. I provided some facts and asked for the style of Raymond Chandler. I've made some editorial changes, but overall it's OK.</small>
