      <h2 class="heading">Background</h2>
      <p>
        When I decided to learn C, a friend suggested I build a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">Chip-8 emulator</a>. In
        addition to learning the language with a small, but non-trivial project,
        I learned quite a bit about how CPUs work - opcodes, memory read/writes,
        buses, framebuffers, etc. So when I needed a project to learn Rust, I
        turned to Chip-8 again. I was able to focus on the language details,
        since I was already familiar with the emulator architecture.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading">Design</h2>
      <p>
        The Chip-8 is an old interpreted language, often picked for a
        programmer's first emulator project. It's reasonably simple, with a
        handful of simple instructions. Input, audio, and display functionality
        are also limited, giving the programmer an introduction to these
        systems, without overwhelming them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The design of my Chip-8R emulator is quite simple. It's broken up into
        the following components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>CPU:</strong>
          <p>
            This struct owns the bus, registers, and frame buffer. The
            <code>Cpu::run()</code> function starts the game loop, handling
            keyboard input; fetching, decoding, and excecuting the next
            instruction; updating the display; decrementing the sound and delay
            timers; and playing audio.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure the emulator runs at 700Hz, the run loop also waits. This
            isn't a cycle-accurate emulator.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bus:</strong>
          <p>
            Similar to a real bus, this component is how the CPU communicates
            with the rest of the system - RAM, the display, the audio system,
            and the keyboard. Rather than calling those modules directly the CPU
            calls bus functions, like <code>Bus::render()</code> and
            <code>Bus::play_audio()</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the bus allows the CPU to query the current keyboard
            state. Two instructions are conditional skips that check if a
            certain key is pressed. Another halts the loop (handled by the CPU)
            until a key is pressed. This state is all exposed by the bus.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means the bus module owns the SDL context used to handle input
            events, draw to screen, and play audio. This context is then passed
            as a reference to those modules.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bus's other critical functions are ROM loading, and the
            introduction prompts. These are rendered using the
            <a href="https://crates.io/crates/native-dialog">native dialog</a>
            crate. I also used this crate to access the file system. Many
            emulators are run from the command line, using arguments for ROM
            loading and other system configs. Instead I wanted to explore Rust's
            native windowing and file system access.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Keyboard (input)</li>
        <li>Display</li>
        <li>Audio</li>
      </ul>
